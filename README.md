# deturno.ar

This project was created to display the shifts of my city's pharmacies on a map. Since this is still an alpha release, you can access the site through **GitHub Pages** by clicking the link below:

## üìå Why am I doing this?
Determining pharmacies' shifts in Argentina is a **legal requirement** for any **College of Pharmacists** in a given area. However, this does not mean that the information is easily accessible. More often than not, the shifts are presented in a way that **severely restricts usability**:

- The schedules are provided in an **image inside a PDF**, with **no alternative text**.
- The image **cannot be copied or clicked**, making it **unreadable for screen readers**.
- Addresses are only presented as **plain text**, making it difficult to determine the closest pharmacy unless you already know the entire city's street grid.
- This lack of accessibility is especially problematic for people in **urgent need of medication outside business hours**, who are often in a **critical situation**.

This project aims to **solve these issues** by providing an interactive and accessible map to easily find open pharmacies.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Was Made
### **Frontend**
- Developed using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
- The map module was built using **OpenStreetMap** (via OpenFreemap), as I don‚Äôt have the resources for a paid API like Google Maps.

### **Backend**
- **Python** was used to **scrape pharmacy data** (name, address, coordinates) from the local College of Pharmacists' website.
- The data was curated to remove inconsistencies.
- Each pharmacy was linked to a **Google Place ID** by searching the name and address via the **Google API**.
- The Place ID was then used to **retrieve updated phone numbers** for each pharmacy.
- The final data was saved in `data/pharmacies_with_phones.json`.

#### **Shift Extraction Process**
1. The **PDF file** from the College of Pharmacists was **converted to a PNG image**.
2. The image was **preprocessed using OpenCV**.
3. Text was extracted using **Tesseract OCR (pytesseract)**.
4. Errors in the OCR output were **corrected using regex and RapidFuzz**, since I already had a list of pharmacy names for spellchecking.
5. The final shift data was saved in `data/turnos.json`, which is then **consumed by the frontend** to display the pharmacies on the map.

## üöÄ Future Improvements
- **Better geolocation integration** for determining the nearest pharmacy automatically.
- **Mobile app version** for easier access.
- **Multilingual support** to make the service more inclusive.
- **Improved OCR accuracy** using machine learning-based text recognition.

## ‚ôø Accessibility
This was the central point of this project.

- The frontend was checked for **colorblindness accessibility** using the **Let's Get Colorblind** extension in Chrome, and later in Firefox because Chrome disabled Ublock Origin and now I dislike them.
- The **HTML includes alternate text** to ensure **screen reader support**.
- The goal is to **get direct feedback from non-sighted individuals** to improve accessibility further.

As of now, I'm still trying to find a feasible way to implement the **search box** so that pharmacies are ordered by proximity to an address.
